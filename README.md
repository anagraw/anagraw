### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ananya Agrawal, a sophomore at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I am a curious mind and self-starter. The sense of satisfaction gained when solving problems at hand, wrecking my brain to link all that I have learned to solve the problem at hand, and brainstorming on new and developing ideas with people brings a beaming smile to my face. I enjoy Web Development using HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, ReactJS, Bootstrap and MongoDB. I am also into competitive programming. 
I am proficient in the following Computer Programming Languages: C, C++, Python
